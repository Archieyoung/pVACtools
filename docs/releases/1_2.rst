Version 1.2
___________

1.2.0
-----

This version introduces multithreading to pVACtools. This significantly speeds
up the execution of pVACseq, pVACfuse, and pVACvector. To turn on
multithreading simply set the ``--n-threads`` parameter to the desired number
of threads. This implementation is not CPU-bound. However, when running the
tools using the IEDB RESTful API, we recommend to keep this number small (<5)
as too many parallel calls to their API might lead to IEDB blocking jobs
submitted from your IP address. It is recommended to use a standalone IEDB
installation when running with multiple threads. By default, multithreading is
turned off.

This version also fixes a few bugs:

- In certain cases pVACvector was not calculating the junction scores
  correctly, leading to potentially finding a peptide order that would include
  high-binding junction epitopes or peptide orders that were not optimal.
  This issue has now been fixed.
- Due to a bug in our packaging code, the 1.1.x versions of pVACtools did not
  include the latest version of the pVACviz code. This version now includes
  the most up-to-date version of the graphical user interface.
