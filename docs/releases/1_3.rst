Version 1.3

1.3.0
-----

This version adds a few features and updates:

- pVACvector now accepts a list of spacers to use when testing junction
  epitopes. These can be specified using the ``--spacers`` parameter with a
  comma-separated list of spacer peptides. Including the string ``None`` will
  also test each junction without spacers. The default is
  ``None,HH,HHC,HHH,HHHD,HHHC,AAY,HHHH,HHAA,HHL,AAL``
- The ``--expn-val`` cutoff parameter has been updated to be a float instead
  of an integer. This allows the user to provide a decimal
  cuttoff for the filtering on gene and transcript expression values.
  Previously, only whole numbers were accepted.
- Decimal numbers in the pVACseq reports are now rounded to three decimal
  places. Previously, they were not rounded.

In addition, this version also fixes a few bugs:

- The ``--normal-vaf`` cutoff value was incorrectly defaulting to 0.2 instead
  of 0.02. This resulted in the coverage filter not being as stringent as it
  should've been.
- There were a number of bugs in pVACapi and pVACviz that would prevent a user
  from submitting jobs using the interface in certain conditions. These have been resolved.
- pVACseq would previsouly not support SVs in the input VCF where the alt had
  a value of ``<DEL>``. These kinds of variants are now supported.
