pVACtools
=========

pVACtools is a cancer immunotherapy tools suite consisting of the following
tools:

**pVACseq**
   A cancer immunotherapy pipeline for identifying and prioritizing neoantigens from a list of tumor mutations.

**pVACfuse**
   A tool for detecting neoantigens resulting from gene fusions.

**pVACvector**
   A tool designed to aid specifically in the construction of DNA-based
   cancer vaccines.

**pVACviz**
   A browser-based user interface that assists
   users in launching, managing, reviewing, and visualizing the results of
   pVACtools processes.

New in version |release|
------------------------

This is a hotfix release. It fixes the following issues:

- The log directories were accidentially included with the pVACseq example data.
  They are now removed.
- Some users were reporting mixed type warnings for pandas when running
  pVACseq. We added some options to avoid this warning.
