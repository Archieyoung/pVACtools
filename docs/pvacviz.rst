pVACviz
=======

pVACviz is the browser-based, graphical user interface for the pVACtools command line tools.
It currently supports starting and managing :ref:`pvacseq` runs as well
as visualizing the results of your runs.

Running pVACviz
---------------

To run pVACviz you first need to start pVACapi, which is used to communicate
between the user interface and the command line tool. pVACapi can be started
by executing the following command on the command line:

.. code::

   pvacapi

While pVACapi is running, you then need to start pVACviz in a separate terminal
window by executing the following command on the command line:

.. code::

   pvacviz

This will open a new browser tab with the pVACviz user interface.
