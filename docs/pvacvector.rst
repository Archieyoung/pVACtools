pVACvector
====================================

pVACvector is designed to aid specifically in the construction of
DNA vector based personalized cancer vaccines. It takes as input either a pVACseq output 
tsv file or a fasta file containing peptide sequences and returns a peptide ordering that
minimizes the effects of junctional epitopes (that may create novel peptides)
between the sequences. It does this by using the core pVACseq services to
predict the binding scores for each junctional peptide. It also tests
junctions with spacer amino acid sequences that may help to eliminate junctional epitopes.
These spacer amino acid sequences can be "HH", "HHC", "HHH", "HHHD", "HHHC",
"AAY", "HHHH", "HHAA", "HHL" or "AAL. The final vaccine ordering is
achieved through a simulated annealing procedure that returns a near-optimal
solution, when one exists.
